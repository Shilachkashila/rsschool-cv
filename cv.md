About Myself:  
-------------

I want to get a new profession to be able to work remotely. I love nature and do not like to live in noisy cities all the time. I am an inquisitive person, I learn quickly and I know how to analyze. Thanks to this, I worked in various professions. Previously, I worked as a crane operator, a seamstress, a gardener, a warehouse worker, a content moderator, and a quality controller.
I like to observe how systems work, and the profession of a programmer gives me the opportunity to create clear logical systems. It is interesting.
